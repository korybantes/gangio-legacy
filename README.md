## Database

The application utilizes MongoDB for data storage. Key collections include:

*   `users`
*   `servers`
*   `serverMembers` (**Note:** Uses camelCase)
*   `roles`
*   `categories`
*   `channels`
*   `messages`
*   `directMessages`
*   `badges`

Performance is optimized through database indexing on frequently queried fields.

**Important:** For detailed schema information, indexing strategies, and specific development guidelines (like collection naming conventions), please refer to [`gangio.md`](mdc:gangio.md).

## Development Notes

*   Always refer to [`gangio.md`](mdc:gangio.md) for the latest database schema and development conventions.
*   Use the `getCollection(db, 'collectionName')` utility from `lib/db.ts` for consistent database collection access, especially for `serverMembers`.
